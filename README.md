How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  > Ensuring your software is functional and secure is something that is conducted multiple times within the development process.
    Utilizing multiple software development tests to find issues and resolve them in a timely manner can help the creation of secure and functional software.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  > User needs can be established through outlining software requirements and building towards the root desires of a company or employer.
    An example of this would be establishing if a user wants a GUI and if so, building out requirements that need to be achieved to develop that need.
    Incorporating them into the program requires a great understanding of the left and right parameters for the project and an action plan to be heavily detailed with the development team.  
How do I approach designing software?
  > When I develop or design software I tend to be objective about setting up requirements and finding exactly what I need to do and I get it done.
    Companies are establishing a link of trust between us as developers and their funds to ensure we produce a product that aligns best with their desires.
    When developing personal projects or software design for yourself, It takes a lot of time and dedication to develop the best product possible.
